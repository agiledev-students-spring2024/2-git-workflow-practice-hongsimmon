[Why AI Can't Completely Replace Human Musicians](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/29/why-ai-cant-completely-replace-human-musicians.html).

## Summary
AI replacing humans has been an imminent concern for various job fields. One of the major concerns of this issue is -- should we let AI overtake fields that require creativity such as music, and is this even possible? However, award winning film composer Joel Beckerman says it is not possible for AI to dominate the music industry due to two main reasons. First, people connect with artists' stories and songs -- they won't be able to connect with a song generated by a non-human. Also, it's difficult to program creativity, as we have little scientific understanding about what creates human creativity. On the other hand, Joel Beckerman also argued that AI tools may still disrupt the music industry.
